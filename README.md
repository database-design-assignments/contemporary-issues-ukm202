# Understanding Big Data, its Current Issues and Challenges
When we say 'Big Data', what exactly is it? How big a data should be to bve considered as 'Big Data'? Well, in this document, I present two articles about Big data with its new Issues and Challenges moving forward and we will understand how Talent shortages present many big daya issues. 


## Article 1
Prior to 3V's definition[Big Data Redux: New Issues and Challenges Moving Forward](https://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/10125/59546/0106.pdf), big data was conceptualiazed as large volumes of data just beyond technology’s capability to store, manage and process efficiently by traditional database methods and tools. Even though many authors have provided their own definition of big data, but majority of them agree with the perspective of 3V's that is Volume, Velocity and Variety of Big data. If the data has high volume, high velocity and has wide variety of information, then the data can be considered as Big data. Unlike the previous understanding, the 3V's of big data is very clear with no ambiguity and gives stable and fundamental understanding of big data. 

With Big data comes many major  challenges such as data privacy issues, fake data generation, and the need for real-time security analytics. Without proper infrastructure, working with this massive data is another big challenge. 


## Article 2
While processing the big data and extracting the meaningful insights is a challenge in itslef, but one of the major challenges of Big data will be/is shortage of Talent too.[Talent Shortages Present Many Big Data Issues] (https://www.tiempodev.com/blog/current-issues-and-challenges-in-big-data-analytics/). An EMC survey revealed 65% of businesses predict they’ll see a talent shortage happening within the next five years. Respondents cited a lack of existing data science skills or access to training as the biggest barriers to adoption. 

There are many solutions to it. As presented in this artcile companies should invest in ongoing training programs that connect learning with on-the-job experience. Companies should partner with multiple organizations and educational institutions to build a diverse candidate pool. Similarly, development of mentorship programs
that will provide proper certificate, bootcamps, MooCs, etc. 

Well, this doesn't actually give the solution of Talent shortage, because big companies cannot give a freelancer to handle its big and important data. There always will be data privacy risk. And if it assigns a legal and reputed companies then will companies prefer skills or college degrees? Who would they hire as their employee?
